0:19 | PROFESSOR: So, if you remember, just before the
0:25 | break, as long ago as it was, we had looked at the problem
0:30 | of fitting curves to data.
0:35 | And the example we had seen, is that it's often possible,
0:42 | in fact, usually possible, to find a good fit to old values.
0:49 | What we looked at was, we looked at a small number of
0:51 | points, we took a high degree polynomial, sure enough, we
0:54 | got a great fit.
0:57 | The difficulty was, a great fit to old values does not
1:03 | necessarily imply a good fit to new values.
1:24 | And in general, that's somewhat worrisome.
1:31 | So now I want to spend a little bit of time I'm looking
1:34 | at some tools, that we can use to better understand the
1:38 | notion of, when we have a bunch of points, what
1:43 | do they look like?
1:45 | How does the variation work?
1:47 | This gets back to a concept that we've used a number of
1:51 | times, which is a notion of a distribution.
1:59 | Remember, the whole logic behind our idea of using
2:04 | simulation, or polling, or any kind of statistical technique,
2:11 | is the assumption that the values we would draw were
2:16 | representative of the values of the larger population.
2:21 | We're sampling some subset of the population, and we're
2:25 | assuming that that sample is representative of the greater
2:30 | population.
2:31 | We talked about several different
2:33 | issues related to that.
2:36 | I now want to look at that a little bit more formally.
2:40 | And we'll start with the very old problem of rolling dice.
2:47 | I presume you've all seen what a pair of
2:50 | dice look like, right?
2:51 | They've got the numbers 1 through 6 on them, you roll
2:54 | them and something comes up.
2:57 | If you haven't seen it, if you look at the very back, at the
3:01 | back page of the handout today, you'll see a picture of
3:05 | a very old die.
3:06 | Some time from the fourth to the second century BC.
3:11 | Looks remarkably like a modern dice, except it's not made out
3:15 | of plastic, it's made out of bones.
3:18 | And in fact, if you were interested in the history of
3:20 | gambling, or if you happen to play with dice, people do call
3:23 | them bones.
3:25 | And that just dates back to the fact that the original
3:28 | ones were made that way.
3:30 | And in fact, what we'll see is, that in the history of
3:35 | probability and statistics, an awful lot of the math that we
3:39 | take for granted today, came from people's attempts to
3:42 | understand various games of chance.
3:46 | So, let's look at it.
3:50 | So we'll look at this program.
3:53 | You should have this in the front of the handout.
4:05 | So I'm going to start with a fair dice.
4:08 | That is to say, when you roll it, it's equally probable that
4:11 | you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
4:18 | And I'm going to throw a pair.
4:20 | You can see it's very simple.
4:23 | I'll take d 1, first die is random dot choice from vals 1.
4:30 | d 2 will be random dot choice from vals 2.
4:34 | So I'm going to pass it in two sets of possible values, and
4:40 | randomly choose one or the other, and then return them.
4:45 | And the way I'll conduct a trial is, I'll take some
4:49 | number of throws, and two different kinds of dice.
4:53 | Throws will be the empty set, actually, yeah.
4:58 | And then I'll just do it.
5:01 | For i in range number of throws, d 1, d 2 is equal to
5:06 | throw a pair, and then I'll append it, and
5:08 | then I'll return it.
5:12 | Very simple, right?
5:14 | Could hardly imagine a simpler little program.
5:19 | And then, we'll analyze it.
5:21 | And we're going to analyze it.
5:22 | Well, first let's analyze it one way, and then we'll look
5:25 | at something slightly different.
5:41 | I'm going to conduct some number of trials
5:43 | with two fair die.
5:46 | Then I'm going to make a histogram, because I happen to
5:50 | know that there are only 11 possible values,
5:55 | I'll make 11 bins.
6:01 | You may not have seen this locution
6:03 | here, Pylab dot x ticks.
6:06 | That's telling it where to put the markers on the x-axis, and
6:10 | what they should be.
6:12 | In this case 2 through 12, and then I'll label it.
6:16 | So let's run this program.
6:29 | And here we see the distribution of values.
6:34 | So we see that I get more 7s than anything else, and fewer
6:39 | 2s and 12s.
6:42 | Snake eyes and boxcars to you gamblers.
6:47 | And it's a beautiful distribution, in some sense.
6:51 | I ran it enough trials.
6:53 | This kind of distribution is called normal.
7:01 | Also sometimes called Gaussian, after the
7:03 | mathematician Gauss.
7:07 | Sometimes called the bell curve, because in someone's
7:12 | imagination it looks like a bell.
7:16 | We see these things all the time.
7:22 | They're called normal, or sometimes even natural,
7:27 | because it's probably the most commonly observed probability
7:30 | distribution in nature.
7:35 | First documented, although I'm sure not first seen, by
7:40 | deMoivre and Laplace in the 1700s.
7:44 | And then in the 1800s, Gauss used it to analyze
7:48 | astronomical data.
7:51 | And it got to be called, in that case, the Gaussian
7:54 | distribution.
7:57 | So where do we see it occur?
7:58 | We see it occurring all over the place.
8:00 | We certainly see it rolling dice.
8:04 | We see it occur in things like the distribution of heights.
8:09 | If we were to take the height of all the students at MIT and
8:12 | plot the distribution, I would be astonished if it didn't
8:17 | look more or less like that.
8:18 | It would be a normal distribution.
8:22 | A lot of things in the same height.
8:24 | Now presumably, we'd have to round off to the nearest
8:26 | millimeter or something.
8:29 | And a few really tall people, and a few really short people.
8:35 | It's just astonishing in nature how often we look at
8:39 | these things.
8:40 | The graph looks exactly like that, or similar to that.
8:44 | The shape is roughly that.
8:47 | The normal distribution can be described, interestingly
8:53 | enough, with just two numbers.
8:57 | The mean and the standard deviation.
9:13 | So if I give you those two numbers, you
9:15 | can draw that curve.
9:18 | Now you might not be able to label, you couldn't label the
9:21 | axes, because how would you know how many
9:25 | trials I did, right?
9:26 | Whether I did 100, or 1,000 or a million, but the shape would
9:29 | always be the same.
9:34 | And if I were to, instead of doing, 100,000 throws of the
9:39 | dice, as I did here, I did a million, the label on the
9:44 | y-axis would change, but the shape would
9:47 | be absolutely identical.
9:51 | This is what's called a stable distribution.
9:54 | As you change the scale, the shape doesn't change.
10:14 | So the mean tells us where it's centered, and the
10:18 | standard deviation, basically, is a measure of statistical
10:23 | dispersion.
10:42 | It tells us how widely spread the points of
10:45 | the data set are.
10:48 | If many points are going to be very close to the mean, then
10:52 | the standard deviation is what, big or small?
10:57 | Pardon?
10:59 | Small.
11:04 | If they're spread out, and it's kind of a flat bell, then
11:08 | the standard deviation will be large.
11:13 | And I'm sure you've all seen standard deviations.
11:16 | We give exams, and we say here's the mean, here's the
11:19 | standard deviation.
11:22 | And the notion is, that's trying to tell you what the
11:25 | average score was, and how spread out they are.
11:29 | Now as it happens, rarely do we have exams that actually
11:35 | fall on a bell curve.
11:37 | Like this.
11:38 | So in a way, don't be deceived by thinking that we're really
11:44 | giving you a good measure of the dispersion, in the sense,
11:48 | that we would get with the bell curve.
11:52 | So the standard deviation does have a formal value, usually
11:58 | written sigma, and it's the estimates of x squared minus
12:11 | the estimates of x, and then I take all of this, the
12:18 | estimates of x, right, squared.
12:26 | So I don't worry much about this, but what I'm basically
12:29 | doing is, x is all of the values I have. And I can
12:36 | square each of the values, and then I subtract from that, the
12:44 | sum of the values, squaring that.
12:50 | What's more important than this formula, for most uses,
12:54 | is what people think of as the -- why didn't I write it down
13:03 | -- this is interesting.
13:07 | There is a some number --
13:09 | I see why, I did write it down, it just
13:10 | got printed on two-sided.
13:12 | Is the Empirical Rule.
13:26 | And this applies for normal distributions.
13:35 | So anyone know how much of the data that you should expect to
13:38 | fall within one standard deviation of the mean?
13:44 | 68.
13:49 | So 68% within one, 95% of the data falls within two, and
13:59 | almost all of the data within three.
14:06 | These values are approximations, by the way.
14:11 | So, this is, really 95% falls within 1.96 standard
14:20 | deviations, it's not two.
14:23 | But this gives you a sense of how spread out it is.
14:28 | And again, this applies only for a normal distribution.
14:33 | If you compute the standard deviation this way, and apply
14:37 | it to something other than a normal distribution, there's
14:40 | no reason to expect that Empirical Rule will hold.
14:52 | OK people with me on this?
14:55 | It's amazing to me how many people in society talk about
14:58 | standard deviations without actually
15:01 | knowing what they are.
15:02 | And there's another way to look at the same data, or
15:06 | almost the same data.
15:07 | Since it's a random experiment, it won't be
15:08 | exactly the same.
15:22 | So as before, we had the distribution, and fortunately
15:28 | it looks pretty much like the last one.
15:30 | We would've expected that.
15:32 | And I've now done something, another way of looking at the
15:35 | same information, really, is, I printed, I plotted, the
15:42 | probabilities of different values.
15:46 | So we can see here that the probability of getting a 7 is
15:52 | about 0.17 or something like that.
15:59 | Now, since I threw 100,000 die, it's not surprising that
16:03 | the probability of 0.17 looks about the same
16:07 | as 17,000 over here.
16:11 | But it's just a different way of looking at things.
16:15 | Right, had I thrown some different number, it might
16:21 | have been harder to visualize what the probability
16:23 | distribution looked like.
16:26 | But we often do talk about that.
16:28 | How probable is a certain value?
16:35 | People who design games of chance, by the way, something
16:39 | I've been meaning to say.
16:39 | You'll notice down here there's just, when we want to
16:42 | save these things, there's this little icon that's a
16:45 | floppy disk, to indicate store.
16:48 | And I thought maybe many of you'd never seen a floppy
16:51 | disk, so I decided to bring one in.
16:53 | You've seen the icons.
16:55 | And probably by the time most of you got, any you ever had a
16:58 | machine with a quote floppy drive?
17:01 | Did it actually flop the disk?
17:04 | No, they were pretty rigid, but the old floppy disks were
17:07 | really floppy.
17:09 | Hence they got the name.
17:12 | And, you know it's kind of like a giant size version.
17:16 | And it's amazing how people will probably continue to talk
17:19 | about floppy disks as long as they talk
17:21 | about dialing a telephone.
17:24 | And probably none of you've ever actually dialed a phone,
17:27 | for that matter, just pushed buttons .
17:29 | But they used to have dials that you would twirl.
17:33 | Anyway, I just thought everyone should at least see a
17:35 | floppy disk once.
17:37 | This is, by the way, a very good way to get data security.
17:40 | There's probably no way in the world to read the information
17:42 | on this disk anymore.
17:48 | All right, as I said people who design games of chance
17:55 | understand these probabilities very well.
17:58 | So I'm gonna now look at, show how we can understand these
18:02 | things in some other ways of popular example.
18:06 | A game of dice.
18:09 | Has anyone here ever played the game called craps?
18:13 | Did you win or lose money?
18:16 | You won.
18:18 | All right, you beat the odds.
18:21 | Well, it's a very popular game, and I'm going to
18:23 | explain it to you.
18:25 | As you will see, this is not an endorsement of gambling,
18:28 | because one of the things you will notice is, you are likely
18:30 | to lose money if you do this.
18:32 | So I tend not, I don't do it.
18:35 | All right, so how does a game of craps work?
18:45 | You start by rolling two dice.
18:50 | If you get a 7 or an 11, the roller, we'll call that the
18:55 | shooter, you win.
19:01 | If you get a 2, 3, or a 12, you lose.
19:08 | I'm assuming here, you're betting what's
19:10 | called the pass line.
19:12 | There are different ways to bet, this is the most common
19:14 | way to bet, we'll just deal with that.
19:17 | If it's not any of these, what you get is, otherwise, the
19:27 | number becomes what's called the point.
19:37 | Once you've got the point, you keep rolling the dice until 1
19:41 | of o things happens.
19:44 | You get a 7, in which case you lose, or you get the point, in
19:56 | which case you win.
20:04 | So it's a pretty simple game.
20:07 | Very popular game.
20:12 | So I've implemented.
20:14 | So one of the interesting things about this is, if you
20:18 | try and actually figure out what the probabilities are
20:22 | using pencil and paper, you can, but it gets
20:25 | a little bit involved.
20:33 | Gets involved because you have to, all right, what are the
20:35 | odds of winning or losing on the first throw?
20:38 | Well, you can compute those pretty easily, and you can see
20:41 | that you'd actually win more than you lose,
20:43 | on the first throw.
20:44 | But if you look at the distribution of 7s and 11s and
20:48 | 2s, 3s, and 12s, you add them up, you'll see, well, this is
20:51 | more likely than this.
20:53 | But then you say, suppose I don't get those.
20:55 | What's the likelihood of getting each other possible
20:58 | point value, and then given that point value, what's the
21:02 | likelihood of getting that before a 7?
21:04 | And you can do it, but it gets very tedious.
21:07 | So those of us who are inclined to think
21:11 | computationally, and I hope by now that's all of you as well
21:15 | as me, say well, instead of doing the probabilities by
21:19 | hand, I'm just going to write a little program.
21:22 | And it's a program that took me maybe 10 minutes to write.
21:27 | You can see it's quite small, I did it yesterday.
21:34 | So the first function here is craps, it returns true if the
21:39 | shooter wins by betting the pass line.
21:43 | And it's just does what I said.
21:46 | Rolls them, if the total is 1 or 11, it
21:48 | returns true, you win.
21:51 | If it's 2, 3, or 12, it returns false, you lose.
21:54 | Otherwise the point becomes the total.
21:58 | And then while true, I'll just keep rolling.
22:01 | Until either, if the total gets the point, I return true.
22:07 | Or if the total's equal 7, I return false.
22:09 | And that's it.
22:12 | So essentially I just took these rules, typed them down,
22:15 | and I had my game.
22:20 | And then I'll simulate it will some number of bets.
22:24 | Keeping track of the numbers of wins and losses.
22:28 | Just by incrementing 1 or the other, depending upon whether
22:31 | I return true or false.
22:34 | I'm going to, just to show what we do, print the number
22:37 | of wins and losses.
22:39 | And then compute, how does the house do?
22:44 | Not the gambler, but the person who's running the game,
22:48 | the casino.
22:49 | Or in other circumstances, other places.
22:53 | And then we'll see how that goes.
22:56 | And I'll try it with 100,000 games.
23:00 | Now, this is more than 100,000 rolls of the dice, right?
23:03 | Because I don't get a 7 or 11, I keep rolling.
23:08 | So before I do it, I'll as the easy question first. Who
23:15 | thinks the casino wins more often than the player?
23:21 | Who thinks the player wins more often than the casino?
23:26 | Well, very logical, casinos are not in business of giving
23:30 | away money.
23:32 | So now the more interesting question.
23:34 | How steep do you think the odds are in the house's favor?
23:38 | Anyone want to guess?
23:43 | Actually pretty thin.
23:45 | Let's run it and see.
23:57 | So what we see is, the house wins 50, in this case 50.424%
24:02 | of the time.
24:04 | Not a lot.
24:06 | On the other hand, if people bet 100,000,
24:08 | the house wins 848.
24:14 | Now, 100,000 is actually a small number.
24:23 | Let's get rid of these, should have gotten rid of these
24:25 | figures, you don't need to see them every time.
24:53 | We'll keep one figure, just for fun.
24:58 | Let's try it again.
25:04 | Probably get a little different answer.
25:06 | Considerable different, but still, less than 51% of the
25:11 | time in this trial.
25:13 | But you can see that the house is slowly but surely going to
25:16 | get rich playing this game.
25:20 | Now let's ask the other interesting question.
25:24 | Just for fun, suppose we want to cheat.
25:29 | Now, I realize none of you would never do that.
25:32 | But let's consider using a pair of loaded dice.
25:36 | So there's a long history, well you can imagine when you
25:39 | looked at that old bone I showed you, that it wasn't
25:43 | exactly fair.
25:44 | That some sides were a little heavier than others, and in
25:47 | fact you didn't get, say, a 5 exactly 1/6 of the time.
25:52 | And therefore, if you were using your own dice, instead
25:55 | of somebody else's, and you knew what was most likely, you
25:57 | might do better.
26:00 | Well, the modern version of that is, people do cheat by
26:02 | putting little weights in dice, to just make tiny
26:06 | changes in the probability of one number or
26:09 | another coming up.
26:11 | So let's do that.
26:14 | And let's first ask the question, well, what would be
26:16 | a nice way to do that?
26:20 | It's very easy here.
26:24 | If we look at it, all I've done is, I've changed the
26:37 | distribution of values, so instead of here being 1, 2, 3,
26:41 | 4, 5, and 6, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 6.
26:46 | I snuck in an extra 5 on one of the two dice.
26:51 | So this has changed the odds of rolling a 5 from 1 in 6 to
26:59 | roughly 3 in 12.
27:04 | Now 1/6, which is 2/12, vs. 3/12, it's not a big
27:09 | difference.
27:10 | And you can imagine, if you were sitting there watching
27:12 | it, you wouldn't notice that 5 was coming up a little bit
27:17 | more often than you expected.
27:19 | Normally.
27:21 | Close enough that you wouldn't notice it.
27:23 | But let's see if, what difference it makes?
27:28 | What difference do you think it will make here?
27:30 | First of all, is it going to be better or
27:32 | worse for the player?
27:36 | Who thinks better?
27:39 | Who thinks worse?
27:42 | Who thinks they haven't a clue?
27:45 | All right, we have an honest man.
27:48 | Where is Diogenes when we we need him?
27:52 | The reward for honesty.
27:55 | I could reward you and wake him up at the same time.
27:58 | It's good.
28:01 | All right, well, let's see what happens.
28:16 | All right, so suddenly, the odds have swung in favor of
28:21 | the player.
28:23 | This tiny little change has now made it likely that the
28:28 | player win money, instead of the house.
28:33 | So what's the point?
28:34 | The point is not, you should go out and try and cheat
28:36 | casinos, because you'll probably find an unpleasant
28:41 | consequence of that.
28:42 | The point is that, once I've written this simulation, I can
28:47 | play thought experiments in a very easy way.
28:52 | So-called what if games.
28:53 | What if we did this?
28:54 | What if we did that?
28:56 | And it's trivial to do those kinds of things.
28:59 | And that's one of the reasons we typically do try and write
29:03 | these simulations.
29:04 | So that we can experiment with things.
29:09 | Are there any other experiments people would like
29:11 | to perform while we're here?
29:13 | Any other sets of die you might like to try?
29:18 | All right, someone give me a suggestion of something that
29:22 | might work in the house's favor.
29:24 | Suppose a casino wanted to cheat.
29:27 | What do you think would help them out?
29:28 | Yeah?
29:28 | STUDENT: Increase prevalence of 1, instead of 5?
29:32 | PROFESSOR: All right, so let's see if we increase the
29:34 | probability of 1, what it does?
29:52 | Yep, clearly helped the house out, didn't it?
29:58 | So that would be a good thing for the house.
30:04 | Again, you know, three key strokes and we get to try it.
30:08 | It's really a very nice kind of thing to be able to do.
30:15 | OK, this works nicely.
30:19 | We'll get normal distributions.
30:21 | We can look at some things.
30:24 | There are two other kinds of distributions I
30:26 | want to talk about.
30:27 | We can get rid of this distraction.
30:40 | As you can imagine, I played a lot with these things, just
30:43 | cause it was fun once I had it.
30:52 | You have these in your handout.
30:57 | So the one on the upper right, is the Gaussian, or normal,
31:01 | distribution we've been talking about.
31:07 | As I said earlier, quite common, we see it a lot.
31:12 | The upper left is what's called a, and these, by the
31:17 | way, all of these distributions are symmetric,
31:19 | just in this particular picture.
31:23 | How do you spell symmetric, one or two m's?
31:26 | I help here.
31:29 | That right?
31:30 | OK, thank you.
31:32 | And they're symmetric in the sense that, if you take the
31:35 | mean, it looks the same on both sides of the mean.
31:40 | Now in general, you can have asymmetric
31:43 | distributions as well.
31:48 | But for simplicity, we'll here look at symmetric ones.
31:51 | So we've seen the bell curve, and then on the upper left is
31:54 | what's called the uniform.
32:04 | In a uniform distribution, each value in the range is
32:09 | equally likely.
32:15 | So to characterize it, you only need to give
32:18 | the range of values.
32:21 | I say the values range from 0 to 100, and it tells me
32:26 | everything I know about the uniform distribution.
32:30 | Each value in that will occur the same number of times.
32:35 | Have we seen a uniform distribution?
32:39 | What have we seen that's uniform here?
32:46 | Pardon?
32:46 | STUDENT: Playing dice.
32:48 | PROFESSOR: Playing dice.
32:49 | Exactly right.
32:51 | Each roll of the die was equally likely.
32:57 | Between 1 and 6.
32:59 | So, we got a normal distribution when I summed
33:03 | them, but if I gave you the distribution of a single die,
33:09 | it would have been uniform, right?
33:11 | So there's an interesting lesson there.
33:14 | One die, the distribution was uniform, but when I summed
33:18 | them, I ended up getting a normal distribution.
33:27 | So where else do we see them?
33:29 | In principle, lottery winners are uniformly distributed.
33:34 | Each number is equally likely to come up.
33:38 | To a first approximation, birthdays are uniformly
33:41 | distributed, things like that.
33:44 | But, in fact, they rarely arise in nature.
33:49 | You'll hardly ever run a physics experiment, or a
33:52 | biology experiment, or anything like that, and come
33:55 | up with a uniform distribution.
33:58 | Nor do they arise very often in complex systems. So if you
34:04 | look at what happens in financial markets, none of the
34:07 | interesting distributions are uniform.
34:10 | You know, the prices of stocks, for example, are
34:13 | clearly not uniformly distributed.
34:16 | Up days and down days in the stock market are not uniformly
34:19 | distributed.
34:22 | Winners of football games are not uniformly distributed.
34:28 | People seem to like to use them in games of chance,
34:32 | because they seem fair, but mostly you see them only in
34:35 | invented things, rather than real things.
34:39 | The third kind of distribution, the one in the
34:41 | bottom, is the exponential distribution.
34:55 | That's actually quite common in the real world.
34:59 | It's often used, for example, to model arrival times.
35:05 | If you want to model the frequency at which, say,
35:08 | automobiles arrive, get on the Mass Turnpike, you would find
35:16 | that the arrivals are exponential.
35:20 | We see with an exponential is, things fall off much more
35:25 | steeply around the mean than with the normal distribution.
35:34 | All right, that make sense?
35:40 | What else is exponentially distributed?
35:43 | Requests for web pages are often exponentially
35:48 | distributed.
35:49 | The amount of traffic at a website.
35:52 | How frequently they arrive.
35:55 | We'll see much more starting next week, or maybe even
35:59 | starting Thursday, about exponential distributions, as
36:03 | we go on with a final case study that we'll be dealing
36:06 | with in the course.
36:09 | You can think of each of these, by the way, as
36:15 | increasing order of predictability.
36:19 | Uniform distribution means the result is most unpredictable,
36:23 | it could be anything.
36:27 | A normal distribution says, well, it's pretty predictable.
36:34 | Again, depending on the standard deviation.
36:37 | If you guess the mean, you're pretty close to right.
36:44 | The exponential is very predictable.
36:47 | Most of the answers are right around the mean.
36:55 | Now there are many other distributions, there are
36:57 | Pareto distributions which have fat tails, there are
37:01 | fractal distributions, there are all sorts of things.
37:05 | We won't go into to those details.
37:09 | Now, I hope you didn't find this short excursion into
37:13 | statistics either too boring or too confusing.
37:17 | The point was not to teach you statistics, probability, we
37:21 | have multiple courses to do that.
37:24 | But to give you some tools that would help improve your
37:27 | intuition in thinking about data.
37:31 | In closing, I want to give a few words about
37:36 | the misuse of data.
37:38 | Since I think we misuse data an awful lot.
37:43 | So, point number 0, as in the most important, is beware of
37:57 | people who give you properties of data, but not the data.
38:25 | We see that sort of thing all the time.
38:29 | Where people come in, and they say, OK, here it is, here's
38:33 | the mean value of the quiz, and here's the standard
38:37 | deviation of the quiz, and that just doesn't really tell
38:42 | you where you stand, in some sense.
38:44 | Because it's probably not normally distributed.
38:47 | You want to see the data.
38:50 | At the very least, if you see the data, you can then say,
38:53 | yeah, it is normally distributed, so the standard
38:57 | deviation is meaningful, or not meaningful.
39:01 | So, whenever you can, try and get, at
39:05 | least, to see the data.
39:14 | So that's 1, or 0.
39:18 | 1 is, well, all right.
39:24 | I'm going to test your Latin.
39:38 | Cum hoc ergo propter hoc.
39:41 | All right.
39:43 | I need a Latin scholar to translate this.
39:49 | Did not one of you take Latin in high school?
39:53 | We have someone who did.
39:55 | Go ahead.
39:55 | STUDENT: I think it means, with this,
39:59 | therefore, because of this.
40:01 | PROFESSOR: Exactly right.
40:03 | With this, therefore, because of this.
40:08 | I'm glad that at least one person
40:09 | has a classical education.
40:12 | I don't, by the way.
40:16 | Essentially what this is telling us, is that
40:19 | correlation does not imply causation.
40:39 | So sometimes two things go together.
40:42 | They both go up, they both go down.
40:45 | And people jump to the conclusion that
40:46 | one causes the other.
40:49 | That there's a cause and effect relationship.
40:53 | That is just not true.
40:57 | It's what's called a logical fallacy.
41:01 | So we see some examples of this.
41:04 | And you can get into big trouble.
41:05 | So here's a very interesting one.
41:08 | There was a very widely reported epidemiological
41:11 | study, that's a medical study where you get statistics about
41:14 | large populations.
41:16 | And it showed that women, who are taking hormone replacement
41:20 | therapy, were found to have a lower incidence of coronary
41:24 | heart disease than women who didn't.
41:28 | This was a big study of a lot of women.
41:32 | This led doctors to propose that hormone replacement
41:38 | therapy for middle aged women was protective against
41:41 | coronary heart disease.
41:44 | And in fact, in response to this, a large number of
41:48 | medical societies recommended this.
41:50 | And a large number of women were given this therapy.
41:55 | Later, controlled trials showed that in fact, hormone
42:00 | replacement therapy in women caused a small and significant
42:04 | increase in coronary heart disease.
42:10 | So they had taken the fact that these were correlated,
42:13 | said one causes the other, made a prescription, and it
42:17 | turned out to be the wrong one.
42:20 | Now, how could this be?
42:25 | How could this be?
42:27 | It turned out that the women in the original study who were
42:33 | taking the hormone replacement therapy, tended to be from a
42:39 | higher socioeconomic group than those who didn't.
42:43 | Because the therapy was not covered by insurance, so the
42:46 | women who took it were wealthy.
42:48 | Turns out wealthy people do a lot of other things that are
42:52 | protective of their hearts.
42:54 | And, therefore, are in general healthier than poor people.
42:57 | This is not a surprise.
42:59 | Rich people are healthier than poor people.
43:02 | And so in fact, it was this third variable that was
43:09 | actually the meaningful one.
43:13 | This is what is called in
43:14 | statistics, a lurking variable.
43:30 | Both of the things they were looking at in this study, who
43:34 | took the therapy, and who had a heart disease, each of those
43:39 | was correlated with the lurking variable of
43:42 | socioeconomic position.
43:46 | And so, in effect, there was no cause and effect
43:49 | relationship.
43:51 | And once they did another study, in which the lurking
43:54 | variable was controlled, and they looked at heart disease
43:59 | among rich women separately from poor women, with this
44:02 | therapy, they discovered that therapy was not good.
44:07 | It was, in fact, harmful.
44:10 | So this is a very important moral to remember.
44:16 | When you look at correlations, don't assume cause and effect.
44:21 | And don't assume that there isn't a lurking variable that
44:25 | really is the dominant factor.
44:29 | So that's one statistical, a second statistical worry.
44:35 | Number 2 is, beware of what's called, non-response bias.
44:48 | Which is another fancy way of saying,
44:51 | non-representative samples.
45:05 | No one doing a study beyond the trivial can sample
45:08 | everybody or everything.
45:11 | And only mind readers can be sure of what they've missed.
45:17 | Unless, of course, people choose to
45:18 | miss things on purpose.
45:20 | Which you also see.
45:22 | And that brings me to my next anecdote.
45:24 | A former professor at the University of Nebraska, who
45:31 | later headed a group called The Family Research Institute,
45:34 | which some of you may have heard about, claimed that gay
45:37 | men have an average life expectancy of 43 years.
45:43 | And they did a study full of statistics showing that this
45:46 | was the case.
45:49 | And the key was, they calculated the figure by
45:53 | checking gay newspapers for obituaries and news about
45:58 | stories of death.
46:00 | So they went through the gay newspapers, took a list of
46:04 | everybody whose obituary appeared, how old they were
46:08 | when they died, took the average, and said it was 43.
46:13 | Then they did a bunch of statistics, with all sorts of
46:15 | tests, showing how, you know, what the curves look like, the
46:19 | distributions, and the significance.
46:21 | All the math was valid.
46:25 | The problem was, it was a very unrepresentative sample.
46:28 | What was the most
46:29 | unrepresentative thing about it?
46:32 | Somebody?
46:33 | STUDENT: Not all deaths have obituaries.
46:38 | PROFESSOR: Well, that's one thing.
46:40 | That's certainly true.
46:41 | But what else?
46:44 | Well, not all gay people are dead, right?
46:48 | So if you're looking at obituaries, you're in fact
46:51 | only getting --
46:52 | I'm sure that's what you were planning to say -- sorry.
46:56 | You're only getting the people who are dead, so it's clearly
46:59 | going to make the number look smaller, right?
47:02 | Furthermore, you're only getting the ones that were
47:05 | reported in newspapers, the newspapers are typically
47:09 | urban, rather than out in rural areas, so it turns out,
47:17 | it's also biased against gays who chose not come out of the
47:22 | closet, and therefore didn't appear in these.
47:26 | Lots and lots of things with the problems.
47:29 | Believe it or not, this paper was published
47:31 | in a reputable journal.
47:34 | And someone checked all the math, but missed the fact that
47:38 | all of that was irrelevant because the sample was wrong.
47:49 | Data enhancement.
47:50 | It even sounds bad, right?
47:53 | You run an experiment, you get your data, and you enhance it.
47:56 | It's kind of like when you ran those physics experiments in
47:59 | high school, and you've got answers that you knew didn't
48:02 | match the theory, so you fudged the data?
48:05 | I know none of you would have ever done that, but some
48:08 | people been known to do.
48:09 | That's not actually what this means.
48:12 | What this means is, reading more into the data than it
48:16 | actually implies.
48:19 | So well-meaning people are often the guiltiest here.
48:23 | So here's another one of my favorites.
48:26 | For example, there are people who try to scare us into
48:29 | driving safely.
48:31 | Driving safely is a good thing.
48:33 | By telling holiday deaths.
48:36 | So you'll read things like, 400 killed on the highways
48:39 | over long weekend.
48:42 | It sounds really bad, until you observe the fact that
48:46 | roughly 400 people are killed on any 3-day period.
48:51 | And in fact, it's no higher on the holiday weekends.
48:56 | I'll bet you all thought more people got
48:58 | killed on holiday weekends.
48:59 | Well, typically not.
49:02 | They just report how many died, but they don't tell you
49:05 | the context, say, oh, by the way, take any 3-day period.
49:12 | So the moral there is, you really want to place the data
49:17 | in context.
49:20 | Data taken out of context without comparison is usually
49:25 | meaningless.
49:27 | Another variance of this is extrapolation.
49:39 | A commonly quoted statistic.
49:42 | Most auto accidents happen within 10 miles of home.
49:45 | Anyone here heard that statistic?
49:48 | It's true, but what does it mean?
49:53 | Well, people tend to say it means, it's dangerous to drive
49:55 | when you're near home.
49:57 | But in fact, most driving is done within 10 miles of home.
50:02 | Furthermore, we don't actually know where home is.
50:06 | Home is where the car is supposedly garaged on the
50:09 | state registration forms. So, data enhancements would
50:14 | suggest that I should register my car in Alaska.
50:18 | And then I would never be driving within 10 miles of
50:20 | home, and I would be much safer.
50:24 | Well, it's probably not a fact.
50:32 | So there are all sorts of things on that.
50:37 | Well, I think I will come back to this, because I have a
50:39 | couple more good stories which I hate not to give you.
50:42 | So we'll come back on Thursday and look at a couple of more
50:45 | things that can go wrong with statistics.
