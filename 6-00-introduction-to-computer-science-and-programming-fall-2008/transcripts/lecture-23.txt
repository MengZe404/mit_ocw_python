0:21 | PROFESSOR: I want to pick up exactly where I
0:24 | left off last time.
0:26 | When I was talking about various sins one can commit
0:29 | with statistics.
0:31 | And I had been talking about the sin of data enhancement,
0:45 | where the basic idea there is, you take a piece of data, and
0:49 | you read much more into it than it implies.
0:51 | In particular, a very common thing people do with data is
0:56 | they extrapolate.
1:01 | I'd given you a couple of examples.
1:08 | In the real world, it's often not desirable to say that I
1:17 | have a point here, and a point here, therefore the next point
1:21 | will surely be here.
1:23 | And we can just extrapolate in a straight line.
1:27 | We before saw some examples where I had an algorithm to
1:30 | generate points, and we fit a curve to it, used the curve to
1:34 | predict future points, and discovered
1:36 | it was nowhere close.
1:40 | Unfortunately, we often see people do this sort of thing.
1:44 | One of my favorite stories is, William Ruckelshaus, who was
1:49 | head of the Environmental Protection Agency
1:52 | in the early 1970s.
1:54 | And he had a press conference, spoke about the increased use
1:58 | of cars, and the decreased amount of carpooling.
2:03 | He was trying to get people to carpool, since at the time
2:05 | carpooling was on the way down, and I now quote, "each
2:10 | car entering the central city, sorry, in 1960," he said,
2:15 | "each car entering the central city had 1.7 people in it.
2:20 | By 1970. this had dropped to less than 1.2.
2:25 | If present trends continue, by 1980, more than 1 out of every
2:30 | 10 cars entering the city will have no driver." Amazingly
2:36 | enough, the press reported this as a straight story, and
2:40 | talked about how we would be dramatically dropping.
2:45 | Of course, as it happened, it didn't occur.
2:49 | But it's just an example of, how much trouble you can get
2:53 | into by extrapolating.
2:56 | The final sin I want to talk about is probably the most
3:00 | common, and it's called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.
3:13 | Now before I get into that, are any of
3:15 | you here from Texas?
3:17 | All right, you're going to be offended.
3:19 | Let me think, OK, anybody here from Oklahoma?
3:23 | You'll like it.
3:24 | I'll dump on Oklahoma, it will be much better then.
3:26 | We'll talk about the Oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy.
3:32 | We won't talk about the BCS rankings, though.
3:37 | So the idea here is a pretty simple one.
3:40 | This is a famous marksman who fires his gun randomly at the
3:45 | side of a barn, has a bunch of holes in it, then goes and
3:52 | takes a can of paint and draws bullseyes around all the
3:59 | places his bullets happened to hit.
4:02 | And people walk by the barn and say, God, he is good.
4:07 | So obviously, not a good thing, but amazingly easy to
4:13 | fall into this trap.
4:16 | So here's another example.
4:17 | In August of 2001, a paper which people took seriously
4:24 | appeared in a moderately serious journal called The New
4:27 | Scientist. And it announced that researchers in Scotland
4:33 | had proven that anorexics are likely to have
4:37 | been born in June.
4:41 | I'm sure you all knew that.
4:44 | How did how did they prove this?
4:45 | Or demonstrate this?
4:47 | They studied 446 women.
4:59 | Each of whom had been diagnosed anorexic.
5:04 | And they observed that about 30 percent more than average
5:21 | were born in June.
5:33 | Now, since the monthly average of births, if you divide this
5:36 | by 12, it's about 37, that tells us that 48
5:43 | were born in June.
5:47 | So at first sight, this seems significant, and in fact if
5:50 | you run tests, and ask what's the likelihood of that many
5:55 | more being born in 1 month, you'll find
5:58 | that it's quite unlikely.
6:04 | In fact, you'll find the probability of this happening
6:08 | is only about 3 percent, of it happening just by accident.
6:16 | What's wrong with the logic here?
6:19 | Yes?
6:19 | STUDENT: They only studied diagnosed anorexics.
6:24 | PROFESSOR: No, because they were only interested in the
6:26 | question of when are anorexics born, so it made sense to only
6:30 | study those.
6:31 | Now maybe you're right, that we could study that, in fact,
6:34 | more people are born in June period.
6:37 | That could be true.
6:38 | This would be one of the fallacies we
6:40 | looked at before, right?
6:42 | That there's a lurking variable which is just that
6:44 | people are more likely to be born in June.
6:47 | So that's certainly a possibility.
6:50 | What else?
6:52 | What else is the flaw?
6:53 | Where's the flaw in this logic?
7:04 | Well, what did they do?
7:06 | They participated in the Oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy.
7:12 | What they did is, they looked at 12 months, they took the
7:17 | months with the most births in it, which happened to be June,
7:23 | and calculated the probability of 3 percent.
7:29 | They didn't start with the hypothesis that it was June.
7:34 | They started with 12 months, and then they drew a bullseye
7:36 | around June.
7:39 | So the right question to ask is, what's the probability,
7:43 | not that June had 48 babies, but that at least one of the
7:49 | 12 months had 48 babies.
7:55 | That probability is a lot to higher than 3 percent, right?
8:04 | In fact, it's about 30 percent.
8:10 | So what we see is, again perfectly reasonable
8:17 | statistical techniques, but not looking at things
8:21 | in the right way.
8:23 | And answering the wrong question.
8:26 | That make sense to everybody?
8:29 | And you can see why people can fall into this trap, right?
8:31 | It was a perfectly sensible, seemingly sensible argument.
8:36 | So the moral of this particular thing is, be very
8:41 | careful about looking at your data, drawing a conclusion,
8:48 | and then saying how probable was that to have occurred?
8:53 | Because again, you're probably, or maybe, drawing
8:56 | the bullseye around something that's already there.
8:59 | Now if they had taken another set of 446 anorexics, and
9:05 | again June was the month, then there would be some
9:09 | credibility in it.
9:11 | Because they would have started with the hypothesis,
9:13 | not that there existed a month, but that June was
9:17 | particularly likely.
9:19 | But then they would have to also check and make sure that
9:22 | June isn't just a popular month to be born, as was
9:25 | suggested earlier.
9:27 | All right, I could go on and on with this sort of thing,
9:30 | it's kind of fun.
9:32 | But I won't.
9:34 | Instead I'm going to torture you with yet one more
9:36 | simulation.
9:39 | You may be tempted at this point to just zone out.
9:43 | Try not to.
9:45 | And as an added incentive for you to pay attention, I'm
9:48 | going to warn you that this particular simulation will
9:52 | appear in the final, or a variant of it.
9:58 | And what we'll be doing is, early next week we'll be
10:02 | distributing code, which we'll ask you to study, about two or
10:06 | three pages of code, and then on the final we'll be asking
10:11 | you questions about the code.
10:13 | Not that you have to memorize it, we'll give
10:15 | you a copy of it.
10:16 | But you should understand it before you walk
10:20 | in to take the final.
10:21 | Because there will not be time to look at that code for the
10:24 | first time during the quiz, and figure
10:26 | out what it's doing.
10:30 | OK, so let's look at it.
10:38 | I should also warn you that this code includes some Python
10:41 | concepts, at least one, that you have not yet seen.
10:46 | We'll see it briefly today.
10:48 | This is on purpose, because one of the things I hope you
10:51 | have learned to do this semester, is look up things
10:55 | you don't know, and figure out what they do.
10:57 | What they mean.
10:59 | Because we obviously can't, in any course, or even any set of
11:03 | courses, tell you everything you'll ever
11:05 | want to know in life.
11:07 | So intentionally, we've seeded some things in this program
11:10 | that will be unfamiliar, so during the time you're
11:13 | studying the program, get online, look it up, figure out
11:16 | what they do.
11:18 | If you have trouble, we will be having office hours, where
11:21 | you can go and get some help.
11:23 | But the TAs will expect you to have at least tried to figure
11:26 | it out yourself.
11:27 | Yeah?
11:27 | STUDENT: Will the final be open note?
11:30 | PROFESSOR: Final will be open book, open notes, just like
11:33 | the quizzes.
11:34 | It will be the first two hours of the allotted time, we won't
11:37 | go the whole 3 hours, OK?
11:44 | So it won't be hugely longer than the quizzes.
11:48 | It would be a little bit longer.
11:49 | And again, very much in the same style of the quizzes.
11:56 | All right, let's look at this.
11:59 | Let's assume that you've won the lottery, and have serious
12:03 | money that you foolishly wish to invest in the stock market.
12:09 | There are two basic strategies to choose from, in investing.
12:15 | You can either have what's called an indexed portfolio,
12:27 | or a managed portfolio.
12:41 | Indexed portfolios, you basically say, I want to own
12:45 | all of the stocks that there are, and if the stock market
12:49 | goes up, I make money, if the stock market goes
12:51 | down, I lose money.
12:53 | I'm not going to be thinking I'm clever, and can pick
12:55 | winners and losers, I'm just betting on
12:57 | the market as a whole.
13:00 | They're attractive, in that a, they don't
13:03 | require a lot of thought.
13:05 | And b, they have what's called a low expense ratio, since
13:09 | they're easy to implement, you don't pay anyone to be
13:11 | brilliant to implement if for you.
13:13 | So they're very low fees.
13:17 | A managed portfolio, you find somebody you think is really
13:21 | smart, and you pay them a fair amount of money, and in return
13:26 | they assert that they will pick winners for you, and in
13:30 | fact, you will outperform the stock market.
13:33 | And if it goes up 6 percent, well you'll go up 10 percent
13:36 | or more, and if it goes down, don't worry, I'm so smart your
13:40 | stocks won't go down.
13:45 | There's a lot of debate about which is the
13:47 | better of these two.
13:52 | And so now we're going to try and see if we can write a
13:55 | simulation that will give us some insight as to which of
14:01 | these might be better or worse.
14:06 | All right, so that's the basic problem.
14:10 | Now, as we know, and by the way we're not going to write a
14:16 | perfect simulation here, because we're going to try and
14:18 | do it in 40 minutes, or 30 minutes.
14:21 | And it would take at least an hour do a perfect simulation
14:24 | of the stock market.
14:26 | All right.
14:29 | First thing we need to do is have some sort of a theory.
14:33 | When we did the spring, we had this theory of Hooke's Law
14:36 | that told us something, and we built a simulation, or built
14:40 | some tools around that theory.
14:42 | Now we need to think about a model of the stock market.
14:47 | And the model we're going to use is based on what's called
14:53 | the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
15:00 | So the moral here, again, is whenever you're doing an
15:05 | implementation of a simulation, you do need to
15:07 | have some underlying theory about the model.
15:12 | What this model asserts is that markets are
15:14 | informationally efficient.
15:31 | That is to say, current prices reflect all publicly known
15:36 | information about each stock, and therefore are unbiased.
15:43 | That if people thought that the stock was underpriced,
15:46 | well people would buy more of it in the price would have
15:49 | risen already.
15:51 | If people thought the stock was overpriced, well, people
15:53 | would have tried to sell it, and it would have come down.
15:56 | So this is a very popular theory, believed by many
16:01 | famous economists today, and in the past. And says, OK,
16:06 | that effectively means that the market is memoryless.
16:13 | OK, that it doesn't matter what the price of the stock
16:16 | was yesterday.
16:18 | Today, it's priced given the best-known information, and so
16:23 | tomorrow it's equally likely to go up or down.
16:29 | Relative to the whole market, right?
16:32 | It's well known that over periods of multiple decades,
16:36 | the market has a tendency to go up.
16:39 | And so there's an upward bias to the stock market, contrary
16:42 | to what you may have seen recently.
16:46 | But that no particular stock is more or less likely to
16:49 | outperform the market, because all the information is
16:53 | incorporated in the price.
16:56 | And that leads to a notion of being able to model the
17:01 | market, how?
17:04 | How would you model individual stocks if you believe this
17:09 | hypothesis?
17:14 | Somebody?
17:15 | What's going to happen?
17:16 | STUDENT: Random walk.
17:18 | PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly right.
17:20 | So we would model it as a random walk.
17:23 | In fact, there's a very famous book called A Random Walk Down
17:26 | Wall Street, that was one of the first to make this
17:30 | hypothesis.
17:34 | Now later, we may decide to abandon this model, but for
17:38 | the moment let's accept that.
17:43 | And let's think about how we're going to build the
17:46 | simulation.
17:53 | Whenever I think about how to build an interesting program,
17:58 | and I hope whenever you think about it, the first thing I
18:01 | think about is, what are the classes I might want to have,
18:05 | what are the types?
18:08 | And it seems pretty obvious that at least two of the
18:12 | things I'm going to want are stock and market.
18:18 | After all, I'm going to try and build a simulation of the
18:22 | stock market, so I might as well have the notion of a
18:26 | market, and probably the notion of a stock.
18:31 | Which should I implement first?
18:35 | Well, my usual style of programming would be to
18:40 | implement the one that's lowest down in the hierarchy,
18:45 | near the bottom.
18:48 | I won't be able to show you what a market does unless I
18:50 | have stocks, but I can look at what an individual stock does
18:55 | without having a market.
18:58 | So why do I implement this first?
19:00 | Because it will be easier to unit test. I can build class
19:06 | stock, and I can test class stock, before I
19:10 | have a class market.
19:16 | So now let's look at it.
19:30 | Clean up the desktop a little bit.
19:38 | This is similar to, but not identical to, what you have in
19:42 | your handout.
19:48 | All right, so there's class stock.
19:53 | And I'm going to initialize it, create them, with an
19:58 | opening price.
19:59 | When a stock is first listed in the market, it comes with
20:02 | some price.
20:06 | I'm gonna keep as part of each stock, it's history of prices,
20:10 | which we can initialize, well, I've initialized it as empty,
20:13 | but that's probably the wrong thing, right?
20:17 | I probably should have had it being the, starting here,
20:26 | right, the opening price.
20:32 | Now comes an interesting part.
20:34 | Self dot distribution.
20:38 | Well, I lied to you a little bit in my description of what
20:46 | it meant to have the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
20:53 | I said that no stock is likely to outperform the market or
20:59 | underperform the market.
21:02 | But it's not quite true, because typically what they
21:06 | actually do that, is they say it's adjusted for risk.
21:21 | It's clear that some stocks are more volatile than others.
21:27 | If you will buy stock in an electrical utility which has a
21:31 | guaranteed revenue stream, because no matter how bad the
21:34 | economy gets, a lot of people still use electricity, you
21:39 | don't expect it to fluctuate a lot.
21:43 | If you buy stock in a high tech company, that sells
21:49 | things on the internet, you might expect it to fluctuate
21:53 | enormously.
21:55 | Or if you buy stock in a retailer, you might expect it
21:59 | to go up or down more dramatically with the economy,
22:04 | and so in fact there is a notion of risk, and I'm not
22:09 | going to do this in this simulation, but usually people
22:12 | have to be paid to take risk.
22:15 | And so it's usually the case that you can get a higher
22:18 | return if you're willing to take more risk.
22:20 | We might or might not have time to come back to that.
22:27 | But more generally, the point is, that each stock actually
22:32 | behaves a little bit differently.
22:36 | There's a distribution of how it would move.
22:39 | So even if, on average, the stock is expected to not move
22:45 | at all from where it starts, some stocks will be expected
22:50 | to just trundle along without much
22:53 | change, not very volatile.
22:56 | And other stocks might jump up and down a lot because they're
23:02 | very volatile.
23:03 | Even if the expected value is the same, they'd
23:07 | move around a lot.
23:10 | So how can we model this kind of thing?
23:12 | Well, we've already looked at the basic notion.
23:16 | Last time we looked at the notion, last lecture we looked
23:19 | at the idea of a distribution.
23:25 | And when we do a simulation, we're pulling the samples from
23:29 | some distribution.
23:33 | It could be normal, everything, that would be a
23:37 | Gaussian, where if you recall there was a mean, and a
23:41 | standard deviation, and most values were going to be close
23:47 | to the mean.
23:49 | Especially if there is a small standard deviation.
23:52 | If there's a large standard deviation it would be spread.
23:56 | Or it could be uniform, where every
23:58 | value was equally probable.
24:00 | We also looked at exponential.
24:03 | So we're going to assign to each stock, when we create it,
24:08 | a distribution.
24:11 | Some way of visualizing, or thinking about, where we draw
24:17 | the price changes from.
24:20 | This gets us into a new linguistic concept, which
24:26 | we'll see down here.
24:29 | You don't have this particular code on your handout, you do
24:33 | have a code that uses the same concept.
24:36 | So here's my unit test procedure.
24:39 | And here's where I'm going to create distributions.
24:42 | And I'm going to look at two.
24:45 | A random-- a uniform, and a Gaussian.
24:49 | What lambda that does, it creates on the fly a function,
24:56 | as the program runs.
24:59 | That I can then pass around.
25:03 | So here, I'm going to look at the thing random dot uniform,
25:08 | for example, between minus volatility and plus
25:11 | volatility.
25:13 | So ignoring the lambda, what do we expect random dot
25:16 | uniform to do?
25:19 | It has equally likely, in the range from minus volatility to
25:26 | plus volatility, it will return any value in here.
25:35 | But notice the previous line, where I am computing
25:39 | volatility.
25:42 | If I wanted every stock to have the same volatility, I
25:47 | could just do that, if you will, at the
25:50 | time I wrote my program.
25:52 | But here I want it to be determined,
25:55 | chosen at run time.
25:57 | So first, I choose a volatility randomly, from some
26:03 | distribution of possible volatilities from 0 to, in
26:06 | this case, 0.2.
26:12 | Think of this as the percentage move per day.
26:17 | So 2/10 of a percent, would be the move here.
26:22 | And then I'll create this function, this distribution d
26:28 | 1, which will, whenever I call it, give me a random, a
26:33 | uniformly selected value between minus and plus
26:37 | volatility.
26:42 | Then when I create the stock, here, I can pass it
26:48 | in, pass in d 1.
26:54 | OK, it's a new concept.
26:55 | I don't expect you'll all immediately grab it, but you
26:58 | will need to understand it before the quiz comes along.
27:05 | And then I could also do a Gaussian one here, with the
27:08 | mean of 0 and the standard deviation of volatility
27:11 | divided by 2.
27:13 | Where do these parameters come from?
27:15 | I made them up out of whole cloth.
27:17 | Later we'll talk about how 1 could think about them more
27:20 | intelligently.
27:24 | Now what do I do with that?
27:29 | All right, we'll see that in a minute.
27:31 | But people understand what the basic idea here is.
27:38 | Now, I can set the price of a stock.
27:44 | And when I do that, I'll append it to history.
27:47 | I can, oh, these have got some remnants which we
27:50 | really don't need.
27:52 | I'll get rid of this which is just an uninteresting thing.
27:58 | And let's look at make move.
28:05 | Because this is the interesting thing.
28:06 | Make move is what we call to change the price of a stock,
28:11 | at the beginning or end of a day if you will.
28:14 | So the first thing it does, is it says, if self dot price is
28:18 | 0, I'm just going to return.
28:23 | This is not the right thing to do, by the way.
28:26 | Again, there are some bugs in here.
28:30 | You won't find these bugs in your handout, right?
28:33 | Code is different in the handout.
28:35 | But I wanted to show these to you so we could think about.
28:39 | What I'm more interested in here than in the result of the
28:41 | simulation, is the process of creating it.
28:46 | So why did I put this here?
28:48 | Why did I say if self dot price equals 0 return?
28:53 | Because the first time I wrote the program, I didn't have
28:57 | anything like that here, and a stock could go
29:00 | to 0 and then recover.
29:03 | Or even go to negative values.
29:05 | Well we know stock prices are never negative.
29:09 | And in fact we know if the price goes to 0, it's delisted
29:12 | from the exchange.
29:14 | So I said, all right, we better make a special case of
29:16 | that. it turns out, that this will be a bug, and I want you
29:24 | to think about why it's wrong for me to put this check here.
29:29 | The check needs to be somewhere in the program, but
29:32 | this is not the right place for it.
29:36 | So think about why I didn't leave it here.
29:40 | OK, then we'll get the old price, which we're going to
29:44 | try and remember, and now comes the interesting part.
29:49 | We're going to try and figure out how the
29:51 | price should change.
29:54 | So I'm first going to compute something
29:56 | called the base move.
29:59 | Think of this as kind of the basis from which we'll be
30:02 | computing the actual move.
30:05 | I'll draw something from the distribution, so this is
30:12 | interesting, I'm now calling self dot distribution, and
30:15 | remember this will be different for each stock.
30:20 | It will return me some random value from either the Gaussian
30:23 | or the normal distribution.
30:28 | With a different volatility for the stocks because that
30:30 | was also selected randomly, plus some market bias.
30:35 | Saying, well, the market on average will go up a little
30:37 | bit, or go down a little bit.
30:42 | And then I'll set the new price, if you will, self dot
30:46 | price, to self dot price times 1 plus the base move.
30:52 | So notice what this says.
30:53 | If the base move is 0, then the price doesn't change.
31:00 | So that makes sense.
31:02 | Interesting question.
31:04 | Why do you think I said self dot price times 1 plus the
31:12 | base move, rather than just adding the base move to the
31:16 | stock, price of the stock?
31:18 | Again, the first time I coded this, I had an addition there
31:22 | instead of a multiplication.
31:24 | What would the ramifications of an addition there be?
31:31 | That would say, how much the stock changed is independent
31:35 | of its current price.
31:39 | And when I ran that it, I got weird results, because we know
31:43 | that a Google priced at, say, 300, is much more likely to
31:49 | move by 10 points in a day than a stock
31:53 | that's priced at $0.50.
31:58 | So in fact, it is the case, if you look at data, and by the
32:02 | way, that's the way I ended up setting a lot of these
32:04 | parameters and playing with it, was comparing what my
32:07 | simulation said to historical stock data.
32:11 | And indeed it is the case that the price of the stock, the
32:14 | move, the amount of move, tends to be proportional to
32:18 | the price of the stock.
32:20 | Expensive stocks move more.
32:22 | Interestingly enough, the percentage moves are not much
32:25 | different between cheap stocks and expensive stocks.
32:29 | And that's why, I ended up using a multiplicative factor,
32:34 | rather than an additive factor.
32:47 | This is again a general lesson.
32:50 | As you build these kinds of simulations, or anything like
32:53 | this, you need to think through whether things should
32:57 | be multiplicative or additive.
32:59 | Because you get very different results, typically.
33:03 | Multiplicative is what you want to do if the amount of
33:07 | change is proportional to the current size, whether it's
33:12 | price or anything else, and additive if the change is
33:16 | independent of the current value, typically, is I think
33:21 | the general way to think about it.
33:27 | Now, you'll see this other kind of peculiar thing.
33:31 | So I've now set the price, and then I've got this test here.
33:39 | If mo, mo stands for momentum.
33:45 | I'm now exploring the question of whether or not stock prices
33:53 | are indeed memoryless, or the stock changes.
34:03 | And the fancy word for that is Poisson.
34:09 | People often model things as Poisson processes, which is to
34:14 | say, processes in which past behavior has no impact on
34:20 | future behavior, it's memoryless.
34:24 | And in fact, that's what the Efficient Market Hypothesis
34:29 | purports to say.
34:31 | It says that, since all the information is in the current
34:35 | price, you don't have to worry about whether it went up or
34:38 | down yesterday, to decide what it's going to do today.
34:45 | There are people who don't believe that, and instead
34:48 | argue that there is this notion called momentum.
34:52 | These are called momentum investors.
34:54 | And they say, what's most likely to happen today, is
34:58 | what happened yesterday.
35:00 | Or more likely.
35:01 | If the stock went up yesterday, it's more likely to
35:03 | go up today, than if it didn't go up yesterday.
35:08 | So I wasn't sure which religion I was willing to
35:12 | believe in, if either, so I added a parameter called, if
35:16 | you believe in momentum, then you should change
35:20 | the price by --
35:23 | And here I just did something taking a Gaussian times the
35:27 | last change, and, in fact, added it in.
35:32 | So if it went up yesterday, it will more likely go up today,
35:35 | because I'm throwing in a positive number, otherwise a
35:39 | negative number.
35:41 | Notice that this is additive.
35:44 | Because it's dealing with yesterday's price.
35:48 | Change, with the change.
35:51 | OK, so that's why we're dealing with that.
35:56 | Now, here's where I should've put in this test
35:59 | that I had up here.
36:03 | Get it out from there.
36:05 | Because what I want to do is, say if self dot price is less
36:08 | than 0.01, I'm going to set it to 0, just keep it there.
36:14 | That doesn't solve the problem we had before though, right?
36:19 | Then I'm going to append it, and keep the last change for
36:26 | future use.
36:28 | OK, people understand what's going on here?
36:32 | And then show history is just going to produce a plot.
36:35 | We've seen that a million times before.
36:37 | Any questions about this?
36:42 | Well, I have a question?
36:45 | Does it make any sense?
36:46 | Is it going to work at all?
36:48 | So now let's test it.
36:51 | So, I now have this unit test program
36:57 | called unit test stock.
37:01 | I originally did not make it a function, I had it in-line,
37:04 | and I realized that was really stupid, because I wanted to do
37:07 | it a lot of times.
37:10 | So it's got an internal procedure, internal function,
37:15 | local to the unit test, that runs the simulation.
37:20 | And it takes the set of stocks to simulate, a fig, figure
37:25 | number, this is going to print a bunch of graphs, and I want
37:29 | to say what graph it is, and whether or not I
37:32 | believe in big mo.
37:35 | It sets the mean to 0, and then for s in the stocks, it
37:41 | moves it, giving it the bias and the momentum, then it
37:46 | shows the history.
37:49 | And then computes the mean of, getting me the mean of all the
37:53 | stocks in it.
37:54 | We've seen this sort of thing many times before.
37:57 | I've then got some constants.
37:59 | By the way, I want to emphasize that I've named
38:02 | these constants to make it easier to change.
38:04 | Starting with 20 stocks, 100 days.
38:10 | And then what I do is, I stock sub 1, stocks 1 will be the
38:15 | empty list, stocks 2 is the empty list. Why do you think
38:19 | I'm starting with bias of 0?
38:27 | Because, what do you think the mean should be, if I simulate
38:32 | various things that the bias of 0?
38:35 | I start $100 as the average price of the stock, what
38:39 | should the average price of the stock be?
38:42 | If my code is correct, what should the average price be,
38:45 | after say, 100 days, if there's no bias.
38:50 | Pardon?
38:51 | 100, exactly.
38:53 | Since there's no upward or downward bias.
38:56 | They may fluctuate wildly, but if I look at enough stocks,
39:00 | the average should be right around 100.
39:03 | I don't know what the average would be if I chose a
39:05 | different bias.
39:07 | It's a little bit complicated, so I chose the simplest bias.
39:11 | Important lesson, so that there would be some
39:14 | predictability in the results, and I would have some, if you
39:18 | will, smoke test for knowing whether or not I was getting,
39:22 | my code seemed to be working.
39:27 | All right, and initially, well, maybe initially, just to
39:31 | be simple I'm going to start momentum equal to false.
39:39 | Because, again, it seems simpler have a model where
39:41 | there's no momentum.
39:43 | I'm looking for the simplest model possible for the first
39:46 | time I run it.
39:49 | And then we looked at this little loop before, for i in
39:51 | range number of stocks, I'm going to create two different
39:55 | lists of stocks, one where the moves, or distributions, are
40:00 | chosen from a uniform, and the other where they're Gaussian.
40:04 | Because I'm sort of curious as to, again, which is the right
40:07 | way to think about this, all right?
40:14 | And then, I'm going to just call it.
40:18 | We'll see what we get.
40:22 | So let's do it.
40:22 | Let's hope that all the changes I mad have not
40:24 | introduced a syntax error.
40:29 | All right, well at least it did something.
40:31 | Let's see what it did.
40:39 | So the test on the left, you'll remember, was the one
40:43 | with test one, I believe, was the uniform distribution, and
40:47 | test two is the Gaussian.
40:51 | So, but let's, what should we do first?
40:55 | Well, let's do the smoke test number one: is the mean more
41:00 | or less what we expected?
41:02 | Well, it looks like it's dead on 100, which was our initial
41:05 | price in test two.
41:09 | And in test one it's a little bit above 100.
41:12 | But, we didn't do that many stocks, or that many days, so
41:16 | it's quite plausible that it's correct.
41:24 | But, just to be sure, not to be sure, but just to increase
41:28 | my confidence, I'm going to just run it again.
41:46 | Well, here I'm a little bit below 100 and in two, and test
41:51 | one a little bit below 100 as well.
41:53 | You remember last time was a little bit above 100.
41:56 | I feel pretty good about this, and in fact I ran it a lot of
41:59 | times in my office.
42:01 | And it just bounces around, hovering around 100.
42:05 | Course, this is the wrong way to do it.
42:06 | I should really just put it in a nice test harness, where I
42:09 | run 100, 200, 1,000 trials, but I didn't want to bore you
42:14 | with that here.
42:15 | So we'll see that, OK, we passed the first smoke test.
42:20 | We seem to be where we expect to be.
42:25 | Well, let's try smoke test two.
42:30 | What else might we want to see, to see if we got things
42:32 | working properly?
42:34 | Well, I kind of ignored the notion of bias by making it 0,
42:39 | so let's give it a big bias here.
42:49 | Assuming it will let me edit it.
43:09 | We just gotta start it up again, it's the
43:11 | safest thing to do.
43:34 | You wouldn't think I would have, I don't have -- all
43:38 | right, be that way about it.
43:42 | Fortunately, we've been through this before.
43:46 | We know if we relaunch the Finder.
43:49 | Who says Mac OS is flawless?
43:58 | All right, we were down here, and I was saying, let's try a
44:07 | larger, introduce a bias.
44:10 | Again, we're trying to see if it does what we
44:12 | think it might do.
44:13 | So what do you think it should do with a bias?
44:17 | Where should the mean be now?
44:21 | Still around 100?
44:24 | Or higher, right?
44:26 | Because we've now put in a bias suggesting that
44:29 | it should go up.
44:31 | Oops.
44:33 | It wouldn't have hurt it.
44:37 | All right.
44:39 | So let's run it.
44:49 | Sure enough, for one, we see, test two, it's a little bit
44:54 | over 100, and for test one it's way over 100.
45:02 | Well, let's make sure it's not a fluke.
45:11 | Try it again.
45:21 | So, sure enough, changing the bias changed the price, and
45:26 | even changed it in the right direction.
45:31 | So we can feel pretty comfortable that it's doing
45:33 | something good with that.
45:35 | We could also feel pretty comfortable that that's
45:37 | probably way too high a bias, right?
45:40 | We would not expect that the mean should be over 160, or in
45:45 | one case, 150, after only 100 days trading, right?
45:49 | Things don't typically go up 50% in 100 days.
45:53 | They go down 50%, but --
46:00 | All right, so that's good.
46:03 | Oh, let's look at something else now.
46:06 | Let's go back to where, a simpler bias here.
46:10 | We'll run it again.
46:13 | And think about, what's the difference between the
46:16 | Gaussian and the normal?
46:26 | Can we deduce anything about those?
46:35 | Not, well, let me ask you.
46:37 | What do you think, yes or no?
46:45 | Anybody see anything interesting here?
46:47 | Yeah?
46:47 | STUDENT: The variance of the Gaussian seems to be less than
46:52 | the variance of the uniform.
46:54 | PROFESSOR: The variance of the Gaussian --
46:55 | STUDENT: -- is less.
46:59 | PROFESSOR: So all right, that appears to be the case here.
47:02 | But let's run it again, as we've done with
47:04 | all the other tests.
47:06 | So we have a hypothesis.
47:09 | Let's not fall victim to the Oklahoma sharpshooter.
47:13 | We'll test our hypothesis, or at least examine it again, see
47:19 | if it's, in some sense, repeatable.
47:27 | Well, now what do we see?
47:32 | Doesn't seem to be true this time, right?
47:35 | Not obviously.
47:37 | So, we're not sure about this.
47:42 | So this is something that we would need
47:43 | to investigate further.
47:49 | And we would need, to have to look at it, and it's going to
47:52 | be very tricky, by the way, as to what the right answer is.
47:57 | But if you think about it, it would not be surprising if the
48:04 | Gaussians, at least, gave us some surprising, more extreme,
48:09 | results, than the uniform.
48:12 | Because the uniform, as we've set it up here, is bounded.
48:16 | The minimum and the maximum is bounded.
48:22 | With the Gaussian, there's a tail.
48:26 | And you might every once in a while get this, at least as
48:29 | we've done it in this case, this large
48:31 | move out at the end.
48:34 | You might not.
48:36 | There's nothing profound about this, other than the
48:40 | understanding that the details of how you set these things up
48:44 | can matter a lot.
48:47 | Well, the final thing I want to look at is momentum.
48:54 | So let's go back, and let's set mo to true here.
49:07 | Well, doesn't want us to set mo to true here.
49:10 | Ah, there it does.
49:16 | So, and now let's run it and see what happens.
49:19 | What do you think should happen?
49:25 | Anybody?
49:26 | STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
49:31 | PROFESSOR: I think you're right.
49:36 | These ones should curl, see if I can -- oh, not bad.
49:41 | Let's run it.
49:48 | Well, it's a little hard to see, but things
49:53 | tend to take off.
49:56 | Because once things started moving, it tends to move in
49:59 | that direction.
50:05 | All right.
50:10 | How do we go about choosing these parameters?
50:12 | How do we go about deciding what to do?
50:14 | Well, we play with it, the way I've been playing with it, and
50:18 | compare the results to some set of real data.
50:22 | And then we try and get our simulation to match the past,
50:26 | and hope that that will help it predict the future.
50:31 | We're not enough time to go through all the,
50:33 | to do that a lot.
50:35 | I will be posting code that you can play with, and I
50:38 | suggest you go through exactly this kind of exercise.
50:42 | Because this is really the way that people do develop
50:45 | simulations.
50:46 | They don't, out of whole cloth, get it
50:48 | right the first time.
50:50 | They build them, they do what if games, they play with them,
50:54 | and then they try and adjust them to get them right.
50:57 | The nice thing here is, you can decide whether you believe
51:00 | momentum and see what it would mean, or not mean, etc.
51:04 | All right, one more lecture.
51:06 | See you guys next week.
